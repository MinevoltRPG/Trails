#Welcome to the Trails config.
General:
    ## Language files are located in /plugins/Trails/lang. Default is en-US.yml. If you edit one into a new language, try to rename the file with a language code from
    ## https://www.alchemysoftware.com/livedocs/ezscript/Topics/Catalyst/Language.htm such as zh.yml or zh-CHS.yml for simplified Chinese for example. You can then set 
    ## this setting here in this file to zh or zh-CHS and it will load properly. If you create a new language file, please send it to me so I can include it in future
    ## updates of the project for all to enjoy! (Email: DrkMatr1984@aol.com)
    Language: en-US
    # SendDenyMessage: set to true will send players a message telling them they cannot create trails in the current area if their trails are toggled on
    # and a protection plugin is blocking them. 
    # The interval is to prevent message spamming. If they remain in an area where they can't create trails, the messages will be spaced apart by this interval,
    # in seconds.
Messages:
    SendDenyMessage: 'true'
    Interval: 10  
Plugin-Integration:
    # Towny integration now works two ways. If 'PathsInWilderness' is set to true, then players will create
    # paths in the Wilderness unless individually toggled off. If TownyPathsPerm is set to true, players with 
    # "trails.towny.town" will create paths anywhere in their hometown, and players with "trails.towny.nation"
    # will create paths anywhere in their nation. Recommend setting these in Towny config permissions for 
    # Assistant, or create your own resident type "TrailMaker" and add perms to that. If TownyPathsPerm is set to false,
    # any player in their home town or nation will create trails in their own town or nation unless they have trails
    # individually toggled off. Players will never create trails in towns that aren't their own or in their Nation.
    Towny:
        PathsInWilderness: 'true'
        TownyPathsPerm: 'false'
    # Lands settings effect the Role Flag. Setting PathsInWilderness: 'true' will always allow paths in wilderness.
    # Setting ApplyInSubAreas: 'true' cause the flag to also be applied in Sub Areas, not just the individual area you have toggled
    # it on in. (Whole Towns/Lands versus individual plots)
    Lands:
        PathsInWilderness: 'true'
        ApplyInSubAreas: 'true'
    # GriefPrevention is automatically detected. If it is found, players must have Build permission to build in a claim. If 'PathsInWilderness' is set to true,
    # then players will create paths in the Wilderness unless individually toggled off.
    GriefPrevention:
        PathsInWilderness: 'true'
    # WorldGuard is automatically detected. Regions with the Trails flag set to false will be protected from trails. Trails flag is trails-flag. Setting 
    # "checkBypass: 'true'" will allow OPs to use trails anywhere regardless of Region settings.
    WorldGuard:
        CheckBypass: 'false'
    # LogBlock and CoreProtect settings both work the same. If set to true and LogBlock and/or CoreProtect are installed, Trails will create rollback data
    # when blocks change using Trails. 
    LogBlock:
        LogPathBlocks: 'true'
    CoreProtect:
        LogPathBlocks: 'true'
    
  ##  Trails are composed of "Links" separated by a ">". Each link comprises 3 numbers: the material, walks to degrade to the next link,
  ## and the percent chance of it occurring. They should follow the following format "material:walks:chance". If you want it to instantly change, change
  ## walks to 0.
  ## Get material names from https://hub.spigotmc.org/javadocs/bukkit/org/bukkit/Material.html 
  ## WARNING: If two trails have one of the same material value links, all Trails will fail. Make sure no two links are the same!
Trails:
    DirtPath: 'GRASS_BLOCK:5:100>DIRT:5:100>COARSE_DIRT:7:30>DIRT_PATH:10:100'
    # This is translated as a GRASS_BLOCK will degrade into DIRT after no more than 5 walks. After that, into COARSE_DIRT after 7 walks, but each walk has a
    # 30% chance of counting. Finally, the COARSE_DIRT will turn into DIRT_PATH after no more than 10 walks. (The step counting system is a little strange
    # sometimes so you may have to tinker with these numbers to get your desired results. 
    SandPath: 'SAND:0:100>SANDSTONE:5:30'
    # Data-Saving allows you to set, in minutes, how often you would like Trails to save it's internal data to disk. It saves async! :)
